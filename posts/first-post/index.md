I'm pretty excited to be writing our first blog post! I'll keep it brief and wanted to just share a quick update on our progress. It's been quite a journey so far. Peter and myself have been immersed in launching our MVP. At the same time we've been attending YCombinator's Startup School which has been a delight - it's so great to be able to meet and connect with so many people that are themselves deep in the creativity process.

All in all it's been great and we're going strong. We're super excited to be launching soon. We will start out by releasing limited functionality at first and then enabling more features as we go.

Stay tune for some great stuff coming up in the next few weeks!
